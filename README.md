# Progress bar example in PyQt5
Many examples in the www of progress bar in PyQt as a single MainWindow.
I needed to make a progress bar as an info progress single window inside a project (not here) that returns data worked in progress.

So here is the example.

Call to get the output data:
```
self.data = barwin.get(None,"Progress load",5)   
```

Some similar can be done to send more structured data to the player class.
